May need some work you can run it if you would like i create things dont get paid so now it is a hobby to earn income

Here’s a professional software bio/metadata file (software_bio.md) you can include in your repo or documentation:

# Multi-Platform GPS-Triggered XMRig Mining System

## Overview
This software suite provides a modular mining controller framework that enables Monero (XMR) mining based on GPS-verified motion. It supports multiple platforms including mobile devices (Android/iOS), Tesla vehicles, and other smart vehicles (Ford, Chevrolet).

Mining activates only when the user or vehicle is moving on verified roads at speeds above 5 mph, ensuring legitimate travel-based mining while maintaining user privacy by processing GPS data locally without external transmission.

## Features
- **GPS Speed Trigger:** Mining starts when speed exceeds 5 mph, scaling at 10 mph.
- **Road Validation:** Ensures mining only occurs on legitimate roads using offline or API map data.
- **Privacy First:** No user location data is stored or sent off-device; only movement proofs are processed.
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Includes modules for mobile phones, Tesla API integration, and extensions for Ford and Chevy connected vehicles.
- **XMRig Integration:** Leverages XMRig for CPU-based Monero mining optimized for each platform.
- **Extensible Architecture:** Modular design enables easy addition of other vehicle integrations or mining algorithms.

## Architecture
- **Core Modules:** GPS speed validation, road verification, and mining control logic.
- **Platform Extensions:** 
  - Mobile app wrappers managing GPS and miner processes.
  - Tesla API client communicating securely for vehicle speed and location.
  - Ford and Chevy API client stubs for future integration.
- **Launcher and Control Scripts:** Unified control to manage mining sessions based on real-time telemetry.

## Use Cases
- Mobile users mining Monero during travel.
- Tesla owners leveraging in-car computing to mine while driving.
- Future expansions to other smart vehicles’ infotainment or digital systems.

2. CPU Power / Hash Rate Estimates Per Unit

Mining Monero depends on CPU performance and efficiency of RandomX. Here’s approximate hash rate ranges for the different platforms based on typical hardware specs:

Platform	Typical CPU / Hardware	Approx. XMR Hashrate (H/s)	Notes

Mobile (Android/iOS)	Mid to high-end ARM CPUs (Snapdragon 8xx, Apple A14+)	20 - 70 H/s	Mobile CPUs are weak miners, high power use and thermal throttling
Tesla Vehicles	Tesla MCU (ARM Cortex-A53 or Nvidia Xavier in latest)	200 - 600 H/s	Tesla’s MCU is decent CPU, can mine but limited by power and heat management
Ford Smart Vehicles	Varies widely; generally ARM Cortex-based infotainment CPUs	100 - 300 H/s	Depends on infotainment system; some have strong CPUs, others less so
Chevy Smart Vehicles	Similar to Ford; ARM Cortex or Intel Atom CPUs	100 - 300 H/s	Mining feasibility varies by model and hardware

Notes on Mining Feasibility:

Mobile and smart vehicle CPUs can mine Monero but at low efficiency compared to dedicated desktops.

Heat and battery consumption in mobile/smart vehicles are major constraints.

Mining while driving is a novel use case but requires careful thermal and energy management.

Tesla’s newer MCU/Nvidia chips can potentially yield the highest hash rates among smart vehicles.
